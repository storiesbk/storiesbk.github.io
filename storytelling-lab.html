				<h2 class="circular-bold">Storytelling Lab</h2>
				<h5 class="circular lead-in">Whether your child is a grapho-maniac always scribbling away or a somewhat reluctant writer, our labs foster a love of words and stories that kids will carry with them for the rest of their lives. Tucked inside our bookshop, the Storytelling Lab has programming after school, on weekends, and over the summer. All labs and camps are taught and facilitated by real life working writers. Some of these writers are close friends, and fellow parents; all are authors and artists whose work we love.</h5>

				<p>Stories Workshops are theme-based and tiered by age. Each 12-week afterschool series costs $500. We hold two one-hour sessions each weekday, from 3:30pm-4:30pm for younger kids, and 4:45pm-5:45pm for our older age group. During each programming cycle the theme will be the same across all age groups, but the level of complexity of the instruction will vary. All Stories students receive with their tuition a custom Stories lined notebook. Our themes include: Adventure Stories, City Stories, Night Stories, Sea Stories, True Stories, and What If Stories.</p>

				<p>A home for storytellers ages 5-13, our lab will host a range of programming from 12-week workshops on the art of the short story to bookmaking classes for younger writers and drop-in sessions where you can bring your latest project for feedback or play a clever assortment of writing games. All taught and facilitated by real life working writers.</p>

					<p class="small-body">Our workshops will be 12-week sessions in which kids form a community of writer/artists helping one another to become the best storytellers we can be. Taking the classic university writing workshop as our model, but reinventing it for a younger writer, Stories Workshops introduce kids to the many way stories can be told, encourage them to experiment with writing their own, and provide a comfortable space for them to hear feedback from their teacher and friends. All Stories Writers will receive with their tuition a custom Stories lined notebook and, at the end of the each session, will help produce a journal of the work.</p>

					<p class="small-body">Each 12-week afterschool series is $500, with each weekly session lasting one hour.</p>

					<p class="small-body">Our Stories School break and Summer Camps will be filled with writing games and exercises that will culminate in a literary journal campers design and create together. These will be half-day camps that expand on our Stories Workshops. Kids will experiment and play with words in a range of writing games and activities, read good stories, have focused time for creating, comment on the work of their friends, and have a chance to revise and polish a final piece, which will be published in a journal of the Stories Summer Writers. We will also receive a snack and have some time outside, weather permitting.</p>

					<p class="small-body">Half-day summer camp is $450 per student per week. Sign up for two weeks, or register a sibling and you will receive 10% off.</p>
