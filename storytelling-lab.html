				<h5 class="circular lead-in">Tucked inside our bookshop, the Storytelling Lab hosts programming for kids after school, on weekends, and over the summer. Whether your child is a grapho-maniac always scribbling away or a somewhat reluctant writer, someone who loves to draw or is simply learning to hold a pen, our labs foster a love of words, pictures, and stories that children will carry with them for the rest of their lives..</h5>

				<p class="small-body">This fall in the Storytelling Lab we are so excited to be offering our first full season of programming. From poetry to animation, collage to acting, your kids can explore a rich range of storytelling arts and form a community of artists and writers under the guidance of an expert teaching artist. In each of our classes we will share published stories, and give students a chance to share and present their work. With registration for every lab you will receive one adorable custom Stories notebook to inspire further scribbling.</p>
